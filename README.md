# A Rainy Evening in the Scottish Highlands – p5.js Game

## About the Project

This p5.js game is themed around *"A Rainy Evening in the Scottish Highlands"*. The visual and interactive elements were designed to reflect the calm, moody, and atmospheric feeling of rain falling over the misty highlands.

### Features and Visual Effects

- **Rain Simulation**: A particle system was implemented to simulate falling rain, inspired by the p5.js particle system lecture.
- **Environmental Dimming**: Dynamic RGB values and gradients create the illusion of the game world gradually darkening, mimicking the effect of rain soaking into the environment and a sky turning stormy.
- **Modular Codebase**: The project is organized into multiple `.js` files to improve performance and make debugging easier. This structure also helps maintain cleaner and more manageable code.

## Tools Used

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) – A JavaScript library for creative coding and visual projects
